# Testing stories

## Tanker

* End-to-end encryption
* SDK available for iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, Windows, Javascript
* Stack:
   * GoLang for server
   * C++ for core "native" SDK
   * Javascript for Web SDK

##

## Testing strategy

* Test suite in C++ for the native SDK
* Test suite in Javascript for the Javascript SDK
* Both use the server deployed in the `dev` environment

## Question

How do we check that C++ and Javascript code do the same thing?

## test vectors (1)

Just hard-code the input and output, making sure
the values are the same

**C++**

```c++
auto const input    = base64::decode(
    "COnKYqlvjWxI33URJj0omXstJu3uLcmmqNmwSxNePAA="
);
auto const expected = base64::decode(
    "Pnpjub2uwkBDpt2HUieWOXP5xLn0Zlen16ID4C7jI=",
);
check_b64_decrypt(input, expected);
```

## test vectors (2)

**JavaScript**


```javascript
const input    = b64Decode(
    "COnKYqlvjWxI33URJj0omXstJu3uLcmmqNmwSxNePAA="
)
const expected = b64Decode(
    "Pnpjub2uwkBDpt2HUieWOXP5xLn0Zlen16ID4C7jI="
)
checkB64Decrypt(input, expected)
```

## e2e tests (1)

* Wrap C++ code in Python to get a Python SDK
* Write a server using msgpack using the Python SDK
* Write a Javascript client using msgpack

## e2e tests (2)

## e2e tests (3)

```javascript
const testServer = new TestServer()

test("encrypt js, decrypt native", () => {
    const message = 'hello'
    const encrypted = tanker.encrypt('hello')
    const msg = {"decrypt", encrypted }
    const response =  testServer.call(msg)
    expect(response).to.eq(message)
});
```


## Question

How do we check that the server is backward-compatible?

## Retro-compat tests (1)


```text
retro-compat-tests/
   tanker-v1.0/
     tests.js
   tanker-v1.2/
     tests.js
   tanker-v2.0/
     tests.js
 ```

## Retro-compat tests (2)

We start the sever on localhost

 For each folder we:

 * Install the public JS SDK matching the version
 * Run all the test suites by connecting to localhost
   instead of the `dev` environment

## Question

How do we check that the SDK is backward-compatible?

## Upgrade tests

For each tuple (v1, v2)

* Encrypt in v1 - store state
* Load state
* Decrypt in v2

\vfill

Yes, this is $O(n^2)$ !

## Why test so hard?

Did not have a choice!

:::incremental
* Bug during upgrade => data loss
* Retro-compat broken => data loss
* Upgrade broken => data loss

# Moral of the stories


## Writing a test

3 questions:

* Is a bug *likely*? remember, it must slip through review and QA
* What's the *severity* of a potential bug?
* How *hard* is the test to write?

## Decision table


| likelihood | severity | easy to write | write it?       |
|------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| high       | high     | yes           |                 |
| low        | low      | yes           |                 |
| low        | high     | no            |                 |
| high       | high     | no            |                 |

## Decision table


| likelihood | severity | easy to write | write it?       |
|------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| high       | high     | yes           | of course!      |
| low        | low      | yes           | probably?       |
| low        | high     | no            | don't bother    |
| high       | high     | no            | yes (no choice) |
