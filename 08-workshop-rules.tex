# Workshops rules

## Grading

Each team will send the code produced for me to review, but you will
*not* be graded based on the code you work.

\vfill

Instead, there will be a short quiz at the end of the workshop
to check what you learned during the workshops.

## Start of each kata

* Find our your team mates and your team names
* Fork the project or create a new one on GitHub or Gitlab
* The project name must contain the name of the kata and your team name,
  for instance `rpn-yellow` for the `rpn` kata and the `yellow` team

## End of each kata

*At the end of each kata*, send me a *link by mail* to GitHub or GitLab
containing the code you wrote.

Feel free to push "work in progress" commits.

Don't worry if you don't finish the kata, every team learns at its own pace,
and it's fine.

If you finish early, let me know and then try and go help other teams.

## Advice for katas

* Choose a language you know well - the time for learning a new one is
  not now :P

* Resist the temptation of splitting the work in 5. Rather, try to
  have the whole group working together.

* Write code as clean as possible.

* Remember the 80/100% rule!

## Last but not least

Have fun, and don't be afraid to make mistakes or ask questions.

Also, if you have an idea for a workshop, feel free to tell me :)
